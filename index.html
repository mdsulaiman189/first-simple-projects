            <p class="t3rd-SP">Life is beautiful! And even more so if you are living a life filled with happiness, peace
                and
                contribution. However, many people, including myself, have lived a life full of possessions, with a
                soul
                full of hatred, a job that sucks the very life out of them, and an emptiness inside.
                <br> <br>
                Even with its struggles and difficulties life can be beautiful,depending what you focus on. A
                beautiful
                life is one that makesyou feel fully alive, is full of inspiration and creates adeeper, more
                connected
                environment for us to live in. With thisin mind I’ve come up with a few steps on how to live a
                beautifullife.</p>
