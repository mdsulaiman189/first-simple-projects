                <p>Life is beautiful! And even more so if you are living a life filled with happiness, peace and
                    contribution. However, many people, including myself, have lived a life full of possessions, with a
                    soul
                    full of hatred, a job that sucks the very life out of them, and an emptiness inside.
                    <br> <br>
                    Even with its struggles and difficulties life can be beautiful,depending what you focus on. A
                    beautiful
                    life is one that makesyou feel fully alive, is full of inspiration and creates adeeper, more
                    connected
                    environment for us to live in. With thisin mind Iâ€™ve come up with a few steps on how to live a
                    beautifullife.</p>
